# microclustr

Performs entity resolution for data bases with categorical fields using partition-based Bayesian clustering models. Includes two new microclustering prior models for random partitions -- ESC models, and the traditional Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor process priors.

## Background

Entity resolution (record linkage or de-duplication) is used to join multiple databases to remove duplicate entities. Recent methods tackle the entity resolution problem as a clustering task. While traditional Bayesian random partition models assume that the size of each cluster grows linearly with the number of data points, this assumption is not appropriate for applications such as entity resolution. This problem requires models that yield clusters whose sizes grow sublinearly with the total number of data points -- `the microclustering property`. The `partitions` package includes two random partition models that satisfy the microclustering property and implements entity resolution with categorical data.

## Main functions

The package contains the implemetation of four random partition models that are used to perform entitiy resolution as a clustering task: 

* Two traditional random partition models: Dirichlet process (DP) mixtures and Pitman–Yor process (PY) mixtures. 
* Two random partition models that exhibit the microclustering property, referred to as: The ESCNB model and the ESCD model.

The main function in `partitions` is `SampleCluster`, which performs entity resolution for the four models. Additionally, we have added the functions `mean_fnr` and `mean_fdr` to evaluate the record linkage performance when ground truth is available.
