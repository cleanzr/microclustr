Description: An implementation of the model in Betancourt, Zanella, Steorts (2020), which performs microclustering models for categorical data. The package provides a vignette for two proposed methods in the paper as well as two standard Bayesian non-parametric clustering approaches for entity resolution. The experiments are reproducible and illustrated using a simple vignette. LICENSE: GPL-3 + file license.
